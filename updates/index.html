        <p>I just want to say, just go to my Mastodon account for everything, i am tired of discovering things here and there... Peace, ZNATLEY!

        <p>A blessed Sunday to everyone who is readding this. Now, as of late, I have been experiencing issues with most of my accounts. Not because something was wrong with them, but because it was too many accounts to manage, and most of them train their AI models on the posts. I will be deleting a LOT of my accounts, leaving only the accounts put on the official links. Also, I have to get some time off of social media, and work on my piano skills, programming skills, animation, etc. I have so much to do, and wasting time on this isnt worth it. That's all for now. Have a great day ahead. Peace, ZNATLEY!  
        </p>

        <p>Hello, hope you are doing well. I have created a Misskey account and decided to dump my 3,000-character posts here instead of Newgrounds, since Newgrounds is inaccessible in some countries. Yes, censorship against innocent websites. Outrageous (I will still use it to upload audio). I have not been very active as of late. It's because I don't have much time to use the computer that much, with piano practice, personal projects, etc., so I haven't got the time to make anything on my computer. Please be patient, soon I will get more time, and hopefully upload a song, gameplay footage, or some animation. I think I will be quitting Roblox for a while. It has been problematic to play on Linux lately, and their updates have been terrible. Unless it has all settled, and everything comes back to normal, I will take a hiatus and play some Geometry Dash. That's all I have to say, continue being awesome y'all, you never know when an idea could spark into a fire. Peace, ZNATLEY!  (edit: no more misskey.)

        <p>Good day to you once again, I hope your day has been good so far. So, my results for my exams came out last week. It was ok, but I still need to work harder and get better marks. I might get my own Computer sooon too, since I'll be taking CS. Lots of things happening, so hope it all works out in the end as God intended it to be. My YouTube channel is gone for now, im trying to recover the handle as soon as possible. For now, it will be @znatgmd. Bummer, but it is what it is. That's all for now, again no Newgrounds update since it is a short one, cya soon (also, anime is quite good man...) Peace, <i>ZNAT</i>LEY!

        <p>Good day to you once again, and I HAVE A NEW NAME. It's just a combination (I forgot the specific English word for this) of Radley and Znat. I think it should make more sense to have a display name as Znatley and username as ZnatGD (People be wondering where Radley came from, even though it isn't my actual name). Small update, no Newgrounds post, because it's a short one Cya all. Peace, <i>ZNAT</i>LEY!

        <p>Good day to you once again, hope you are doing good. So, these past few days, I've been browsing around the fediverse, so I will give an update on which websites I will be most active: Mastodon, Pixelfed, Reddit, Newgrounds, GitHub, YouTube, and Telegram. Mastodon is where I will be posting "tweets", Pixelfed is where I will be sharing photos (any type, whether some work in progress, current status, or some photos i clicked on my camera), Reddit is where unfinished/cancelled work will be, Newgrounds is <i>where the light is</i> ;), GitHub is for my OSS, YouTube is gaming & VODs, and Telegram is for DMs. Other platforms is where I made an account to avoid identity theft. Thank you for listening to this. Cya all. Peace, RADLEY! (edit: misskey and lemmy are the only actPub accounts ill be ysing, it's too much for me to be using too many)

        <p>Hello once again, I have finally gotten the time to post here on my website once again... Thank you for your patience, I have not found the time to post anything on YouTube, because I am quite busy with piano lessons. But I assure you, it will be quite good in the end. At least, i hope so. So, recently, if you haven't seen, Sober was blocked during The Hunt: Mega Edition. If you dont know what Sober is, Sober is a new solution for linux users to run Roblox. It does not use the Windows version, but uses an Android environment instead. Check it out <a href="https://sober.vinegarhq.org">here</a>. As of now, it is still in full operation. But Roblox is planning to release Hyperion for Android soon. If this is so, then us Linux players will be greatly affected. Even though I do not use Linux at the moment, when I do get my own computer, I plan to run Fedora, and the inability to run Roblox on Linux will be very sad. In addition to this, play Roblox on my mother's phone will also be impossible: after the Hyperion update, many old computers just refused to run Roblox, because it took so much resources. For now, Hyperion for Android is still very slow in terms of development, but I fear RoL players will face worse days to come. For now, we hope that Roblox doesn't take away our last window of opportunity, and exploiters do not take advantage of this. But Roblox Studio still works perfectly under WINE, so animations wouldn't be a problem. I guess, if Roblox is blocked again, im back to Geometry Dash? Anyways, hope you all have a blessed day ahead, and regardless of the situation at Roblox, I'm happy that life is good. Cya all. Peace, RADLEY!

        <p>This will be the last time i post on this website in this post style content, visit Newgrounds for such stuff now... Peace, RADLEY. (Edit [April 03, 2025]: I will continue to update here, I realise that not many people have access to Newgrounds... even i have to use a VPN...)
        </p>
        <h2 id="2">March 13, 2025</h2>
        <p>I have relocated the entire website now, so i expect everything on my side to settle down, in terms of links, usernames, and so on. I wont be moving my stuff here and there any longer. @ZnatGD is mostly everything else informal, and @GnamRBX is... of course, formal stuff. Thank you for all of your support, and see you all soon. Peace, RADLEY!
        </p>

        <p>You may have noticed that I've come back. Yes, I'm finally back. After a year of being virtually offline, I'm back. Now, you may see a few changes: for one, Im on Roblox. Yes, finally understood what Roblox is. And the biggest takeaway for me was that DOORS is on Roblox! I honestly thought it was a Steam game. So, yeah. But I am not playing DOORS at the moment, I'm playing Guts & Blackpowder. I hope i will be able to stream it on YouTube soon, but no plans anytime soon. After a year of using Linux, my laptop broke because of poor maintenance (by me), and i am using my mother's computer for now. It's faster than mine, but i wont be able to use it 24/7, and (sob) it is running windows 11. I can't boot windows 10 because EOL is coming soon, and i cant boot linux either because she needs MSOffice, so total bummer for me. But, gotta deal with it till i get my own computer. I've become a Mobile Gamer, so expect me to constantly fail when i livestream lol. I have a Mastodon account now, im more active there. And, you can always PM me on Newgrounds. Anyways, I'm in the middle of school exams so I will be taking a break for now. Will be back soon, fellas. Cya till then. Peace, RADLEY!
