        <p>Not my actual name, though. I'm a Musician (7 years experience), Game Developer, and I'm currently trying to learn how to make a game, model something out of nothing, and basically everything to do with games.</p>
        <p>If you would like to support me, you can just subscribe to my YouTube channel. It would really help me as of now, when i dont have a donation link or Roblox game.</p>

        <p>This will be the last time i post on this website in this post style content, visit Newgrounds for such stuff now... Peace, RADLEY. (Edit [April 03, 2025]: I will continue to update here, I realise that not many people have access to Newgrounds... even i have to use a VPN...)
        </p>

        <p>I have relocated the entire website now, so i expect everything on my side to settle down, in terms of links, usernames, and so on. I wont be moving my stuff here and there any longer. @ZnatGD is mostly everything else informal, and @GnamRBX is... of course, formal stuff. Thank you for all of your support, and see you all soon. Peace, RADLEY!

        <p>You may have noticed that I've come back. Yes, I'm finally back. After a year of being virtually offline, I'm back. Now, you may see a few changes: for one, Im on Roblox. Yes, finally understood what Roblox is. And the biggest takeaway for me was that DOORS is on Roblox! I honestly thought it was a Steam game. So, yeah. But I am not playing DOORS at the moment, I'm playing Guts & Blackpowder. I hope i will be able to stream it on YouTube soon, but no plans anytime soon. After a year of using Linux, my laptop broke because of poor maintenance (by me), and i am using my mother's computer for now. It's faster than mine, but i wont be able to use it 24/7, and (sob) it is running windows 11. I can't boot windows 10 because EOL is coming soon, and i cant boot linux either because she needs MSOffice, so total bummer for me. But, gotta deal with it till i get my own computer. I've become a Mobile Gamer, so expect me to constantly fail when i livestream lol. I have a Mastodon account now, im more active there. And, you can always PM me on Newgrounds. Anyways, I'm in the middle of school exams so I will be taking a break for now. Will be back soon, fellas. Cya till then. Peace, RADLEY!
